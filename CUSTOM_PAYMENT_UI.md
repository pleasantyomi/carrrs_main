# Custom Payment UI with Flutterwave Integration

## Overview

I've created a custom payment UI that integrates with Flutterwave to offer multiple payment methods in a beautiful, user-friendly interface. This replaces the simple PaymentButton component with a comprehensive payment solution.

## Features

### 🎨 Beautiful Custom UI
- Modern, responsive design with gradient backgrounds
- Professional payment method selection cards
- Real-time fee calculation and display
- Security badges and trust indicators
- Animated loading states and transitions

### 💳 Payment Methods Supported
1. **Debit/Credit Cards** (Most Popular)
   - Nigerian and international cards
   - Automatic card number formatting
   - CVV and expiry validation
   - PIN support for Nigerian cards
   - Fee: ₦100 + 1.4%

2. **Bank Transfer**
   - Direct bank transfer option
   - All major Nigerian banks supported
   - Account number validation
   - Fee: ₦50

3. **USSD**
   - Phone-based payment
   - All major Nigerian banks
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Fee: ₦50

4. **Mobile Money**
   - MTN, Airtel, Glo, 9mobile support
   - SMS-based payment flow
   - Voucher code support
   - Fee: ₦100

## File Structure

```
components/payment/
├── custom-payment-ui.tsx       # Main custom payment component
└── payment-button.tsx          # Original simple button (still available)

app/payment/
├── checkout/
│   └── page.tsx                # Custom payment page
├── success/
│   └── page.tsx                # Payment success page (existing)
└── failed/
    └── page.tsx                # Payment failure page (existing)

app/api/payments/
├── initialize/
│   └── route.ts                # Initialize payment record
├── process/
│   └── route.ts                # Process payment with Flutterwave
└── verify/
    └── route.ts                # Verify payment status
```

## How It Works

### 1. Booking Flow Integration
When users complete their booking details (for cars, stays, or services), they click "Proceed to Payment" which redirects them to:
```
/payment/checkout?booking_id={id}&amount={total}&type={booking_type}
```

### 2. Custom Payment Page
- Loads booking and user details
- Displays the CustomPaymentUI component
- Handles authentication and verification
- Shows loading states and error handling

### 3. Payment Processing
The custom UI processes payments through these steps:
1. **Initialize** - Creates payment record in database
2. **Process** - Sends payment data to Flutterwave API
3. **Verify** - Confirms payment status and updates booking

### 4. Payment Methods
Each payment method has specific handling:

#### Card Payments
```typescript
{
  type: "card",
  card: {
    card_number: "1234567890123456",
    cvv: "123",
    expiry_month: "12",
    expiry_year: "25",
    pin: "1234" // For Nigerian cards
  }
}
```

#### Bank Transfer
```typescript
{
  type: "bank_transfer",
  bank: {
    code: "044", // Access Bank
    account_number: "1234567890"
  }
}
```

#### USSD
```typescript
{
  type: "ussd",
  ussd: {
    code: "044" // Bank code for USSD
  }
}
```

#### Mobile Money
```typescript
{
  type: "mobile_money_nigeria",
  mobile_money: {
    phone: "08012345678",
    network: "MTN",
    voucher: "optional_voucher_code"
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Flutterwave Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=FLWPUBK_TEST-your-public-key
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=FLWSECK_TEST-your-secret-key
FLUTTERWAVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key
FLUTTERWAVE_WEBHOOK_HASH=your-webhook-hash

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { CustomPaymentUI } from "@/components/payment/custom-payment-ui"

export function PaymentPage() {
  return (
    <CustomPaymentUI
      amount={25000}
      bookingId="booking_123"
      userEmail="user@example.com"
      userName="John Doe"
      userPhone="08012345678"
      bookingType="car"
      onSuccess={(response) => {
        console.log("Payment successful:", response)
        // Redirect to success page
      }}
      onError={(error) => {
        console.error("Payment failed:", error)
        // Handle error
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

## Payment Flow

1. **User Selection** - Choose payment method from beautiful cards
2. **Form Filling** - Enter payment details with validation
3. **Fee Display** - See transparent fee calculation
4. **Processing** - Secure payment processing with loading states
5. **Completion** - Success/failure handling with appropriate redirects

## Security Features

- 🔒 256-bit SSL encryption
- 🛡️ Flutterwave security badges
- 🔐 Secure API endpoints with authentication
- ✅ Payment verification and webhook handling
- 🚫 Input validation and sanitization

## Responsive Design

The payment UI is fully responsive and works perfectly on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones
- All screen sizes

## Benefits Over Simple Payment Button

1. **Better User Experience** - Multiple payment options in one place
2. **Transparency** - Clear fee breakdown and total calculation
3. **Trust** - Professional design with security indicators
4. **Flexibility** - Support for all Flutterwave payment methods
5. **Mobile-First** - Optimized for mobile payments
6. **Error Handling** - Better error messages and recovery options

## Next Steps

1. **Test Payment Flow** - Try different payment methods
2. **Customize Styling** - Adjust colors and branding
3. **Add More Features** - Saved cards, payment history, etc.
4. **Setup Webhooks** - Configure Flutterwave webhooks for production
5. **Go Live** - Switch to production keys when ready

The custom payment UI is now fully integrated into your booking flows and ready for testing!
